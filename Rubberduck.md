Top Mistakes:
lost 2 hours of work for not displaying items as flex early on so that I could center items using 
align items and justify content.. program looks jumbled up on smaller monitor








It appears that I will need one big square container 
with a border that contains 3 boxes for email, password, continue

I need a form, so i will use the form element
theres a box around the form so I will use the border function? in CSS
For every label I will create an input
labels are important because they identify all form controls
the "for" (in labels) and ID (in inputs) must match!
the "for" inside labels binds the label to the input element (they are optional)
the input element is self-closing and has a "type", "id", 
and "name" (used to reference the html element in javascript),  
and sometimes even placeholders (text that disappears once you type) and values (text thats is pre-plugged in a text-box or values for radio buttons)
there are many input types like radio buttons, forms, checkboxes, submit buttons, etc
the id is the class that can be used to add styling in css, remember that the id name should match the for name

a elements are for hyperlinks, linking websites and other pages


at the end of each line in a form, a break can be used so that
everything is displayed vertically on separate lines



for footers:
use footer element
inside footers you can type inside of p tags (paragraphs)
&copy; creates a copyright watermark



i notice a box that says 103 x 31 may be useful for later?


CSS:

I noticed there's solid lines used as dividers
to do this you must use HR element, hr means horizontal rule
for solid use hr.solid
for dotted use hr.dotted
for dashed use hr.dashed
for rounded use hr.rounded
